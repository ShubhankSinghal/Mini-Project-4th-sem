# Mini-Project-4th-sem
This project was made for my 4th semester mini-project.

Topic : Develop and Deploy a website using any cloud vendors, e.g., IBM Cloud

## Inspiration
This website is made after our college official website for first year B.Tech Students: www.btechgeu.in

## What it does
This website have multiple tabs where students can find notices, syllabus, time table, assignments and a contact-us page for students to ask theire queries. The queries are send to the provided mail and they are also stored in the IBM Cloudant.

## How I built it

## Challenges I ran into
The main challenge that I faced was to think of an idea to develop a website. Then, another challenging part was to design the UI. Then after developing the website, the process to send mail on the contact-us page was also a tricky part, because I made it using NodeMailer module of NodeJS. After the development, step to deploy the website on IBM Cloud and use of IBM Cloudant was indeed another challenge. Integreting all of them together took most of the time.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The website that I made is what I am proud of. Because, learning and practically implementing are totally two different things. I just not only developed this website but also depolyed it on the IBM Cloud. And I also learned many new things eg., Use of IBM Cloud Foundry, IBM Cloudant and NodeMailer of NodeJS. 

## What I learned
Along with the practical implementation of HTML, CSS-BootStrap and JavaScript on a website, I learned to deploy a website on IBM Cloud. I also implemented NodeJS in-order to use NodeMailer, a module used to send E-Mails, in the Contact-us page. I have also integrated this website with IBM Cloudant that stores all the queries requested on the Contact-Us page.

# What's next for the project
As I don't have a good knowledge of Back-end, the next step will be to learn NodeJS for Back-end and shift the whole website on NodeJS.

## Built With
* HTML
* CSS-BootStrap
* JavaScript
* NodeJS
* IBM Cloud Foundary
* IBM Cloudant

(IBM Cloud link will usually be not active, as for lite accounts, it has to be redeployed after a period of 10 days)
